## Hi, I'm Metabead ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner full-stack developer and digital creative learning to build across the web and blockchain stack â€” from JavaScript to NFTs.

Currently exploring:
- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Smart contracts & Web3 apps
- NFT tooling & generative art
- Project-based learning under the **Metabead** brand

My mission is to combine code, creativity, and crypto into powerful digital tools and stories.  
Letâ€™s build something rare.
